What is HiCoin?

----------------



HiCoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. HiCoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. HiCoin Core is the name of open source

software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of

the HiCoin Core software, see http://www.friendshipcoins.com
